We usually start developing a web site prototyping the interface and then
implementing HTML/CSS and bacis JavaScript. In case
of using the full BEM stack a tranformation from prototype to a functioning web
site goes smoothly. You can clone the project from
[project-stub](https://github.com/bem/project-stub) and create a static web page
as it was [described
earlier](http://bem.info/articles/start-with-project-stub/).
<excerpt/>

Thanks to `BEMHTML` templates, you do not need write all the HTML manually.
Describing page sructure in `BEMJSON` rather than writing all the tags manually
saves time. But sometimes this is still a lot of work to do, especially for large
pages.

Luckily BEMJSON can include JavaScript pieces to produce some blocks dymamically.
I created an example of such usage:

```js
({
    block: 'page',
    ...
    content:[
        ...
        {
            block: 'content',
            content: (function() {
                var res = [];
                for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                    res.push({
                        block: 'button',
                        content: 'Button ' + (i + 1)
                    });
                }
                return res;
            })()
        },
        ...
    ]
})
```

This JavaScript creates 10 `button` blocks when the page is being built with
`bem-tools`.
Check the [result
page](http://varya.me/dynamic-bemjson/desktop.bundles/page1/page1.html)
to see them.

Another example is a `menu` block. Such interface pieces usually consist of a
lot of items with minor differences which cases a lot of copy-paste on a page.
With JavaScript in BEMJSON this can be easily reduced.

```js
({
    block: 'page',
    ...
    content:[
        ...
        {
            block: 'menu',
            content: [
                {
                    title: 'Index',
                    isSelected: false,
                },
                {
                    title: 'Products',
                    isSelected: true
                },
                {
                    title: 'Contact',
                    isSelected: false
                }
            ].map(function(item){
                var block = {
                    block: 'menu',
                    elem: 'item',
                    content: item.title,
                    mods: {
                        selected: item.isSelected
                    }
                };
                return block;
            })
        },
        ...
    ]
})
```
[full
code](https://github.com/varya/dynamic-bemjson/blob/master/desktop.bundles/page2/page2.bemjson.js)

This gives a [page with a menu of 3 items](http://varya.me/dynamic-bemjson/desktop.bundles/page2/page2.html).
The bigger is the array of items, the more you save. Especially when the structure
of every item changes while developing.

Indeed, this feature is not needed when BEMJSON is a result of 1st layer templates
(like BEMTREE, priv.js) you can produce as much BEMJSON as is necessary. But with
initial development of a static web page, the JavaScript tricks help to avoid
copy-paste.
